- README is clear and complete

- a lot of warnings:
    - declare static the returned reference to a local variable
    - pay attention to the types of integer when comparing them

- not much gain in computational time with compression

- definition of friend operators should be outside of the class

- missing non const call operator()(int i, int j)

- good use of the std library
